	Roles describes the function of a single person in this system.
	As you can see, there are divided into categories and you get the existing roles to a category by clicking on it.
	Click on the role you want to edit. If you want to add a user-role to a Use-Case,
	click on the green plus in the upper right corner and select the Use-Case you want to add.
	This method is also working with views and actions. These new rights are available after relogging into the system.
